## Research Objectives 

## Hypotheses 

## Methods 

### *Experimental Design and Procedure* 

#### Suspended Sediment Measurements 

#### Vegetation Measurements 

## Data Acquisition and Analysis 

### *Suspended Sediment Measurements* 

### *Long and Short Term Accretion Measurements* 

### *Vegetation Monitoring Measurements* 

## Potential Management Impact/Insights 

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
