## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `ec`

```{r}
## read gapminder csv. Note the readr:: prefix identifies which package it's in
gapminder <- readr::read_csv(https://github.com/Smillersfsu/Biol708/blob/main/Code/ELKVEG2016%20.xlsx ) 
```

`ho: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
